# Klinik Pintar Test Assessment

live url: https://dreamy-spence-74da1c.netlify.app/

This project is for klinik pintar frontend intern test assessment
Built using vue 3, Vuex, and tailwind

There are some flaws in this project such as:
* API can't be called due to CORS
* Filter functionality (Province, All filters) is stripped due to API call inability
* UI inconsitency

I belive the flaws can be fixed with API availability provided figa mockup for better pixel match, and more time to finish.
